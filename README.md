The visually impaired are not able to skim through articles and pick the ones that are interesting to them. This app fixes that. Take a picture of a article. This app will tell you the over sentiment of the article (you might not want to read something with a negative connotation) and a summary of it. You can click on the screen at any time to query like "who is x" or "what is y" and the app will tell you and then continue the summary.

Used HPs idolondemand stack.

Some parts are hardcorded so that the application did not crash. Almost fully functional
